CourseGrapher
=============
Thie is a site that graphs [PennCourseReview] (http://penncoursereview.com) data in bubble charts using the Google Charts api.  This is a more maintainable rewrite of an app that won second place at [PennApps Hackathon] (http://pennapps.com) in September 2011.


Note
----
The graph can't be shown by just viewing the file in the browser. You can test it locally by running `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in the directory.
